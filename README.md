This notebook is prepared to run in Google Colab. Before running heavy training cells, set `Runtime -> Change runtime type -> GPU`.


## Project Objectives

- **General Objective:** Design and evaluate a transformer-based NER system for Nya-Hoba.
- **Specific Objectives:**
  1. Collect, clean, and annotate a Nya-Hoba text corpus for NER tasks.
  2. Develop baseline NER models using traditional machine learning approaches for benchmarking.
  3. Fine-tune transformer-based models for NER on Nya-Hoba.
  4. Evaluate model performance using Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
  5. Release an open-source dataset and pre-trained models.
